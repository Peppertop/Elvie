About the Fonts
===============

Although there are lots of "free as in beer" fonts available, there is a distinct lack of Open Source fonts. This goes doubly for comic fonts, which has limited our options somewhat.

We have endeavoured to use fonts in our Elvie strips that are at least free for us to redistribute. Please check the licence included with each font, however, before using them for other projects.


List of Fonts
-------------

* Komika Axis - Used for the main "Elvie" logo.
* Komika Text - Used for the body text in our strips.

* Atari Small - Used in the arcade machine screen in strip #002.
