All our original files are licensed as CC-BY-SA (see below for more details about derivative works). Some third party support files (such as fonts) may be under other licenses. Please check the README in the relevant directory for more details.

This repository contains the source files used to create these comic strips. Each comic is in its own subdirectory and contains the following file types:

* *.ora - Drawn using MyPaint and often subsequently edited using The GIMP.
* *.png - Exported from the *.ora files using The GIMP and used within the individual comic panels.
* *.svg - Inkscape source files, used for the final text and layout of the comic.
* *.jpg - The final comic, exported from Inkscape then colour adjusted in The GIMP, as the strips otherwise print a little dark.

Blatant Plug

On our website (http://www.peppertop.com) you can also find two other comic strips (both licensed CC-BY-NC-SA):

* **The Greys** - A series of over 100 stand-alone comic strips, parodies of sci-fi and cult TV shows. Drawn using Inkscape, with the source SVG files available to download.
* **Monsters, Inked** - Originally a newspaper strip, so a series of individual gags. There is an ongoing plot developing, though. Drawn by hand and then coloured, lettered and composited using Inkscape.
