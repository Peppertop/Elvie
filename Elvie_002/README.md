Elvie #002
==========
This Elvie strip appeared in issue #2 of 'Linux Voice' magazine, which included an article on building an arcade machine using a Raspberry Pi, and an article about Grace Hopper. These two articles were combined to form the basis of this strip.

The text at the bottom of the game screen uses the "Atari 8-bit" font that can be found in our resources directory.
