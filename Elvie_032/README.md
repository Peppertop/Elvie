Elvie #032
==========
This strip appeared in issue #32 of Linux Voice magazine, and coincided with the 25th anniversary of the first
release of the Linux kernel.

Although we didn't realise it at the time, this was to be the last stand-alone issue of Linux Voice - although
the comic strip then continued into the Linux Voice section of Linux (Pro) Magazine.
