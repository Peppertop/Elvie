Elvie #014
==========
This strip appeared in issue #14 of Linux Voice magazine. We were told that
this edition would include an article about creating images using hand-coded
SVG, hence this strip. When the magazine was released, however, it turned
out that the article was about creating images using the SVG-edit application
(https://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/). To keep with the theme, this strip
was created entirely as an SVG image, with no bitmap components (albeit 
using Inkscape (www.inkscape.org), rather than hand-coded).
